**A simple fighting game in Python with, trust me, a LOT of room for improvement.**

This game was created for Computer Science III. Each character only has a simple close-range attack, as I didn't have the time or knowledge to go much further with it. Word of advice: Don't try to edit the files for character sprite positions and sizes, it is a huge pain because apparently I didn't know how to make a user-friendly format.

The background is from a Street Fighter game, and the sprites are from itch.io.
